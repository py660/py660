# Necessity-Driven Tools
Sometimes, I really need some sort of added or customized functionality, which could be a ChatGPT to Discourse quote converter or an extension which calculates weighted and precise percentile grades for each class.
* **PowerSchool Grade Percentage Viewer:** This tool is an extension, a bookmarklet, and a portable website, all in one repository. Originally written as a userscript, it was requested for by my friends as a way to precisely track their grades and prioritize assignments which would boost their grade the most.
* **ChatGPT Script Parser to Discourse:** I would often generate heroic stories of hackers and programmers using ChatGPT to post in a discourse forum. However, ChatGPT didn't know how to correctly quote users using Discourse's BBCode. To combat this, I spun up a quick program which would allow me to dynamically format the script.
* **Advanced HTML Email Editor:** I have always wondered how companies and other commercial entities were able to send nicely-formatted web-page-like emails even though most common email services (such as GMail) only allowed text content and basic formatting. When I learned that you could send HTML through email, I created a GMail plugin which allowed you to insert arbitrary HTML into the email that you were composing.
* **Replit Delete Tool:** With a new 10GB storage quota imposed on all Replit accounts, I would have to delete some of my empty repls, aka codespaces, to continue using the service (Spoiler: I would end up migrating to GitHub and VSCode Tunnels due to additional changes by Replit).
* **DRM Repls:** On Replit, all free repls had to be public, which would be a problem if you were developing code that you didn't want to be available for the entire world to see. To combat this, I created a template which would automatically encrypt and decrypt your code using a secure password, meaning that only you and users who have the password would be able to view and run the code.
* **Replit Database UI:** Debugging Replit Databases is extremely hard, as it is not easy to manipulate their content using a user-friendly interface. Instead of waiting for change, I wrote a command-line app which would allow you to explore the database like a file system and modify its content on the spot.
* **All-purpose Pinger:** Many websites would end up going to sleep after a period of inactivity (such as Glitch, Render, Old Replit). To keep them awake, I used Google Apps Script to create a web service which would ping user-submitted URLs every 30 seconds to keep them wide awake.
* **Replit Teams-For-EDU Repl Downloader:** With the impending deprecation of Replit Teams For Education, which would leave thousands of CS educators without an LMS, many teachers have yet to receive instructions on how to export their assignments for usage in other LMS's. Instead of waiting, I created a bookmarklet/userscript which would download all projects automatically.
* **Email Autoresponder & iMessage Bot:** This project was more of a prank than an actual tool, since my main purpose of using it would be to prank certain users whenever they would send an email/message to me.
* **PoTW Downloader:** Puzzling math problems are extremely interesting to me, and MathCounts had provided a entire archive of two years worth of math problems. However, they wouldn't last long as older problems would be overwritten by newer ones, and I would need a way to preserve this data. This is why I created this cron script which would automatically download any new problems which had been uploaded to the website every week.
* **AMC10 Autograder:** My love for mathematics and programming didn't end there, as I would end up with more opportunities to integrate the two together. In preparation for the AMC10, I would solve practice tests to emulate the real test situation. However, grading them would be a problem, as having my parents grade them would take a long time, and grading them myself would expose me to the answers. Hence, the AMC10 autograder was created to grade tests for me.
